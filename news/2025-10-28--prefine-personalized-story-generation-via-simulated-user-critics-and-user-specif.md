Conventional approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a user&#39;s interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user&#39;s behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets. We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems, education, and recommendation.
