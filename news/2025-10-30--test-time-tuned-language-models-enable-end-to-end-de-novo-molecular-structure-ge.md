However, current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning, enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap, enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively. Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification.
