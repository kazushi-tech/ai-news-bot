This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and dynamically modifying the model&#39;s policy at each node. When combined with data scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy. However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score (r-score), which measures the query&#39;s learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.
