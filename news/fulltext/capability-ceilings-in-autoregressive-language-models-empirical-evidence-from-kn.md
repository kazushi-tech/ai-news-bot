Systematic evaluation of OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling) reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse (complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse architectural approaches. Comments: The experiments in this paper were performed in January 2024. Current model architectures are considerably more complex than those presented here Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Cite as: arXiv:2510.21866 [cs.AI] &nbsp; (or arXiv:2510.21866v1 [cs.AI] for this version) &nbsp; https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.21866 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite (pending registration) ## Submission history From: Javier Marín [view email] [v1] Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:09:31 UTC (813 KB) Full-text links: ## Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled Capability Ceilings in Autoregressive Language Models: Empirical Evidence from Knowledge-Intensive Tasks, by Javier Mar\&#39;inView PDFHTML (experimental)TeX Source view license Current browse context: cs.AI &lt;&nbsp;prev &nbsp; | &nbsp; next&nbsp;&gt; new | recent | 2025-10 Change to browse by: cs ### References &amp; Citations NASA ADSGoogle Scholar Semantic Scholar export BibTeX citation Loading... ## BibTeX formatted citation &times; loading...
