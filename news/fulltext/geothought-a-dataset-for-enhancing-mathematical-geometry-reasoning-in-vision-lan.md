Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model produces correct answers.
