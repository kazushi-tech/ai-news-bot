While the problem has been studied for decades, recent years have seen renewed interest in the topic across AI applications such as robotics, transportation, and operations research, reflecting the reality that real-world systems rarely optimize a single measure. This paper surveys developments in MOS while highlighting cross-disciplinary opportunities, and outlines open challenges that define the emerging frontier of MOS Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Cite as: arXiv:2510.25504 [cs.AI] &nbsp; (or arXiv:2510.25504v1 [cs.AI] for this version) &nbsp; https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.25504 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite (pending registration) ## Submission history From: Oren Salzman [view email] [v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:30:01 UTC (86 KB) Full-text links: ## Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled Multi-Objective Search: Algorithms, Applications, and Emerging Directions, by Oren Salzman and 3 other authorsView PDFHTML (experimental)TeX Source view license Current browse context: cs.AI &lt;&nbsp;prev &nbsp; | &nbsp; next&nbsp;&gt; new | recent | 2025-10 Change to browse by: cs ### References &amp; Citations NASA ADSGoogle Scholar Semantic Scholar export BibTeX citation Loading... ## BibTeX formatted citation &times; loading...
