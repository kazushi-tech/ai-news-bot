Using a miniature greenhouse as a test platform, four predictive models Linear, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) are developed and compared under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Three control strategies Model Predictive Control (MPC), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Large Language Model (LLM) based control are also implemented to assess trade-offs in precision, adaptability, and implementation effort. Results show that in modeling HAM provides the most balanced performance across accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency, while LSTM achieves high precision at greater resource cost. Among controllers, MPC delivers robust and predictable performance, RL demonstrates strong adaptability, and LLM-based controllers offer flexible human-AI interaction when coupled with predictive tools.
